1. Project Overview
This project is a Student Management System implemented in C++. The system allows users to perform basic operations such as adding, editing, deleting, and displaying student records. Each student has attributes like name, roll number, marks, and grade. The grade is calculated based on the marks entered by the user.

2. Objective
The main objectives of the project are:

To manage student information such as name, roll number, marks, and grade.
To provide functionalities for adding, updating, deleting, and displaying student records.
To calculate the grade of students based on their marks.
To create a simple console-based application for managing student data.
3. Key Activities
Adding Students: Input student details (name, roll number, marks), calculate the grade, and store the data.
Editing Student Details: Search for a student by roll number and allow updating their information such as name and marks.
Deleting Students: Search for a student by roll number and remove the student record from the system.
Displaying Students: Show the list of all students along with their details (name, roll number, marks, and grade).
Grade Calculation: Grades are assigned based on the marks of the student using a predefined grading system.
4. Technology Used
Programming Language: C++
Data Structures:
Vector: Used to store student records dynamically.
Concepts Used:
Object-oriented programming (OOP) for defining the Student and StudentManagementSystem classes.
Basic input/output operations for user interaction.
Iterating over a collection of student records using vector and performing operations like add, edit, delete, and display.
